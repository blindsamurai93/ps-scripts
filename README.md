# ps-scripts

Hello! This is my personal GitHub page that I use to store scripts that I have written to turn common administrative and technical tasks into one-click solutions. Roughly 6 years ago, my mentor dropped a nugget of wisdom for me in regards to scripting and automation:

"If you do it more than 3 times in a day and more than 6 times a week, then you can automate it."

These words have stuck with me and as a SysAdmin with increasingly more time consuming tasks, it's always a boon knowing that more of the day to day operations can be automated, leaving more time to focus on more pressing matters.
